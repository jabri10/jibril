            <p>The Quran is divided into 114 chapters, called surahs, which cover theology, morality, law, and guidance for personal conduct.</p>

            <p>Muslims are encouraged to live in harmony with others, regardless of faith, and to be peacemakers in society. Islam's teachings call for compassion, helping the needy, and forgiving others to build peaceful communities.</p>
